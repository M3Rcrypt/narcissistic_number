# narcissistic_number
In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as a pluperfect digital invariant (PPDI), an Armstrong number (after Michael F. Armstrong) or a plus perfect number) in a given number base b is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. (Wikipedia)

In this python code the base (b) is 10 and it produces all the narcissistic numbers in an infinite loop.
